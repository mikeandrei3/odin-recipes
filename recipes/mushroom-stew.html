    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p style="width: 400px;">French-style mushroom stew is a rustic, comforting dish featuring tender mushrooms simmered in a rich, savory sauce often made with garlic, onions, herbs, and sometimes wine or cream. It’s hearty, aromatic, and pairs well with crusty bread or rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces button mushrooms, chopped</li>
        <li>8 ounces cremini mushrooms, chopped</li>
        <li>8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, chopped</li>
        <li>8 ounces oyster mushrooms, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cups roughly chopped onions</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed, divided</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 large leek, white and light green parts only, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups dry red wine</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tamari, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme, chopped</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol style="width: 400px;">
        <li>Combine mushrooms and onions in a large bowl; toss gently to mix.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a very large pot over medium-high heat. Add mushroom-onion mixture, in batches, to cover bottom of pot in a single layer; cook, without stirring too much, until begins to brown and caramelize on one side, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir and cook until other side is browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl using a slotted spoon. Add 2 tablespoons oil to the pot; repeat with another batch mushroom-onion mixture. Repeat until all mushroom-onion mixture is cooked.</li>
        <li>Season mushroom-onion mixture with salt and black pepper; set aside.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low; add 1 tablespoon oil to the same pot. Add carrots and leek; cook until leek turns light golden and starts to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomato paste; cook 1 minute. Add flour; cook and stir 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Stir in wine, vegetable broth, tamari, thyme, bay leaves, and cayenne pepper while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Carefully add mushroom-onion mixture; bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low; simmer, partly covered, until carrots and onions are tender and sauce has thickened, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
